# medmnist_ensemble_study
Official implementation of "Validation Starvation". We benchmark heterogeneous ensembles (ConvNeXt, ViT) on MedMNIST v2. Proposes a new heuristic: Meta-Learning (Stacking) for data abundance, Soft Voting for validation scarcity. Achieves SOTA across 4 datasets (+15% on DermaMNIST) with calibrated uncertainty for reliable clinical AI.
